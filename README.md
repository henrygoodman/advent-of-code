Tracking my solutions for the advent of code 2022. 
Will probably be written all in Python.

Skills Learned:
- Class construction, repr methods useful for visualization (multiple days)
- List comprehensions (multiple days)
- BFS pathfinding algorithm (day12)
- Input parsing nested lists using json
- Bubble sort using custom comparison method between nested list data structures.
- Using zip() to iterate multiple iterables at once (returns a tuple of both iterables at index i, return length is min length) (day13, not implemented but learn after the fact)
